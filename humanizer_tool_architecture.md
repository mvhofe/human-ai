# Humanizer Tool: Architecture Design

## 1. Introduction

The primary objective of the Humanizer Tool is to take English text that is suspected of being AI-generated and transform its phrasing to appear more natural and characteristic of human writing. This design is informed by comprehensive research into the typical identifiers of AI-generated content, aiming to address these markers systematically.

## 2. Core Design Principles

Several core principles guide the architecture of this tool:

*   **Modularity:** The tool will be constructed from distinct, independent modules. This approach facilitates easier development, testing, and future upgrades or replacements of individual components without affecting the entire system.
*   **Extensibility:** The architecture is designed to be easily extendable. New text analysis techniques, transformation rules, or stylistic adjustments can be incorporated with minimal disruption to the existing framework.
*   **Focus on Stylistic Transformation:** It is crucial to emphasize that this tool focuses on altering the *style* and *phrasing* of the text. It is not designed to perform fact-checking, verify the accuracy of the content, or understand the semantic intent beyond what is necessary for stylistic modification.
*   **User-Centric (Conceptual):** While the initial implementation will be a backend tool or library, the design considers eventual user interaction, aiming for clarity in how transformations are applied and what aspects of the text are being targeted.

## 3. System Components

The Humanizer Tool will comprise the following interconnected components:

### A. Input Handler
*   **Function:** This module is responsible for receiving the raw text input from the user or another system.
*   **Details:** It will be designed to handle plain text input. Future enhancements could include support for various document formats, but the initial focus is on simple text strings.

### B. Text Preprocessor
*   **Function:** Before analysis and transformation, the input text needs to be prepared. This module handles cleaning and structuring the text.
*   **Details:** Key preprocessing steps will include:
    *   **Sentence Segmentation:** Breaking the text into individual sentences.
    *   **Word Tokenization:** Dividing sentences into individual words or tokens.
    *   **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging:** Identifying the grammatical role of each token (e.g., noun, verb, adjective). This is crucial for context-aware transformations.
    *   **Lemmatization:** Reducing words to their base or dictionary form (e.g., "running" to "run").

### C. AI-Characteristic Analyzer
*   **Function:** This module analyzes the preprocessed text to identify patterns and characteristics commonly associated with AI-generated content, based on the prior research phase.
*   **Sub-components/Checks:** The analyzer will incorporate several checks:
    *   **Lexical Diversity Scorer:** Measures the richness of vocabulary and flags the overuse of common, simple words. It might calculate a type-token ratio or compare word frequencies against standard human writing corpora.
    *   **Repetition Detector:** Identifies and quantifies repeated words, phrases (n-grams), and potentially similar sentence structures using techniques like cosine similarity for sentence embeddings.
    *   **Sentence Structure Analyzer:** Examines sentence length variability, complexity (e.g., use of subordinate clauses), and common syntactic patterns. AI text often exhibits monotonous sentence structures.
    *   **Formality and Vividness Assessor (Heuristic-based):** Looks for indicators of overly formal language (e.g., lack of contractions, passive voice overuse) or a lack of vivid, descriptive language.
    *   **Perplexity Evaluation (Optional):** AI-generated text often has low perplexity (it's highly predictable). If feasible, this could be an additional signal, though it might require a language model.

### D. Transformation Engine
*   **Function:** This is the core of the Humanizer Tool. It applies a suite of targeted transformations to the text to mitigate the AI-like characteristics identified by the Analyzer.
*   **Sub-modules:** The engine will consist of several specialized transformation modules:
    *   **i. Lexical Substitution Module:** Aims to increase vocabulary diversity and reduce predictability.
        *   Replaces overused common words with appropriate synonyms using a thesaurus (e.g., WordNet).
        *   Introduces more varied and less predictable word choices, considering POS tags to ensure grammatical correctness.
    *   **ii. Sentence Rephrasing & Restructuring Module:** Focuses on breaking textual monotony.
        *   Alters sentence structures: converting between active and passive voice, splitting overly long or complex sentences, combining short, choppy sentences for better flow.
        *   Introduces variations in sentence openings and overall phrasing patterns.
    *   **iii. Contraction & Idiom Integration Module:** Aims to make the text sound more conversational and natural for English.
        *   Inserts common English contractions (e.g., "it is" to "it's", "do not" to "don't") where grammatically and stylistically appropriate.
        *   Carefully introduces mild, common idiomatic expressions or phrasal verbs to enhance naturalness. This must be handled with caution to avoid making the text sound forced or incorrect.
    *   **iv. Redundancy Reduction Module:** Addresses direct repetition.
        *   Removes or rephrases redundant words, phrases, or sentences identified by the Analyzer.
    *   **v. (Future Enhancement) Tone and Style Modulator:** For more advanced humanization.
        *   Could allow for subtle adjustments in tone (e.g., making text slightly more informal, persuasive, or engaging) based on predefined rules or even light interaction with a fine-tuned language model for rephrasing suggestions.

### E. Post-processor & Output Formatter
*   **Function:** This module takes the transformed text, performs any necessary cleanup, and prepares it for final output.
*   **Details:** Responsibilities include:
    *   Ensuring grammatical coherence after transformations (a light grammar check might be integrated).
    *   Correctly joining modified sentences and tokens back into a readable text format.
    *   Normalizing spacing and punctuation.

### F. (Conceptual) User Interface / API
*   **Function:** Provides the means for a user or another application to interact with the Humanizer Tool.
*   **Details:** For the initial project, this will likely be a Python script or a library with a defined API that accepts text input and returns the humanized output. Future developments could include a simple web-based user interface (UI) or a REST API for broader integration.

## 4. Workflow

The operational flow of the Humanizer Tool will be as follows:

1.  **Input:** User provides the AI-generated text to the Input Handler.
2.  **Preprocessing:** The Text Preprocessor cleans, tokenizes, tags, and lemmatizes the input text.
3.  **Analysis:** The AI-Characteristic Analyzer evaluates the preprocessed text, identifying and scoring various AI-like features.
4.  **Transformation:** Based on the analysis, the Transformation Engine applies a sequence of modifications through its sub-modules. The selection and intensity of transformations can be guided by the Analyzer's output. Transformations might be applied iteratively, with checks to ensure meaning preservation as much as possible.
5.  **Post-processing:** The Post-processor cleans up the transformed text, ensuring grammatical integrity and proper formatting.
6.  **Output:** The Output Formatter presents the final, humanized text to the user or calling system.

## 5. Tentative Technologies & Libraries (Python Implementation)

*   **Core Language:** Python 3.11+
*   **Natural Language Processing (NLP):**
    *   NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): For sentence tokenization, word tokenization, POS tagging, lemmatization, and access to WordNet (for synonyms).
    *   spaCy (Optional, for more advanced features): Could be used for more robust POS tagging, dependency parsing, or named entity recognition if needed for more complex transformations.
*   **Thesaurus:** WordNet (accessed via NLTK or a dedicated Python library).
*   **Custom Python Modules:** Each component and sub-module described in the architecture will be implemented as a distinct Python module or class.

## 6. Limitations & Future Enhancements

*   **Subjectivity:** The perception of "human-like" text can be subjective. The tool will aim for generally accepted characteristics of natural language.
*   **Meaning Preservation:** While efforts will be made to preserve the core meaning, complex transformations always carry a risk of subtle semantic shifts. This will be a key area of focus during testing.
*   **Over-Correction:** There's a potential risk of over-correcting, making the text sound unnatural in a different way. Balancing the transformations will be important.
*   **Factuality:** As stated, the tool will not verify or correct factual information within the text.
*   **Future Enhancements:**
    *   More sophisticated tone and style adjustment capabilities.
    *   User-configurable style profiles (e.g., "formal human," "informal human").
    *   Integration with larger language models (LLMs) for more nuanced rephrasing suggestions, used as a component within the transformation engine.
    *   A feedback mechanism for users to rate the quality of humanization, potentially for model refinement.

This architectural design provides a foundational blueprint for developing the Humanizer Tool. Each component will be developed and tested to contribute to the overall goal of making AI-generated text more natural and engaging.
