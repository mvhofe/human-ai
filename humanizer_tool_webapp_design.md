# Web Humanizer: Interface Design

## 1. Objective

To create a simple, intuitive, and user-friendly web interface for the Text Humanizer tool. The interface should allow users to easily input text, trigger the humanization process, and view the transformed output.

## 2. Key Interface Elements

The web page will be a single-page application for simplicity and will consist of the following main components:

### a. Title/Header
*   A clear title for the application, e.g., "Text Humanizer" or "AI Text Refiner".
*   A brief subtitle or description explaining the tool's purpose, e.g., "Transform AI-generated text into more natural, human-like phrasing."

### b. Input Section
*   **Input Text Area:**
    *   A large, resizable text area (e.g., `<textarea>`) where users can paste or type the text they want to humanize.
    *   A placeholder text like "Paste your AI-generated text here..."
    *   Clear labeling, e.g., "Original Text".
*   **Control Parameters (Optional, for v1 could be fixed or simplified):**
    *   **Lexical Substitution Rate:** A slider or a number input to control the intensity of synonym replacement (e.g., from 0.0 to 0.5, defaulting to 0.15 or 0.2). Label: "Synonym Strength".
    *   **Apply Contractions:** A checkbox (checked by default) to enable/disable the introduction of contractions. Label: "Use Contractions".
    *   *(For the initial version, these parameters might be set to default values on the backend to simplify the UI, with options to expose them later.)*
*   **Submit Button:**
    *   A clearly labeled button, e.g., "Humanize Text" or "Make it Sound Human".
    *   This button will trigger the API call to the backend with the input text and selected parameters.

### c. Output Section
*   **Output Text Area:**
    *   A large, read-only text area to display the humanized text returned by the backend.
    *   Clear labeling, e.g., "Humanized Text".
    *   A placeholder text like "Your humanized text will appear here..."
*   **Copy to Clipboard Button (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   A button next to the output text area to allow users to easily copy the transformed text.

### d. Analysis Display (Optional)
*   A section (perhaps collapsible or below the output) to display the analysis of the *original* text, as generated by the `AICharacteristicAnalyzer` module.
*   This could show metrics like:
    *   Lexical Diversity (TTR)
    *   Most Frequent Words
    *   Repeated Phrases
    *   Sentence Length Variability
    *   Passive Voice Heuristic Count
*   Label: "Analysis of Original Text".

### e. Footer (Optional)
*   Brief information, e.g., "Powered by Manus AI" or a link to the project source if applicable.

## 3. User Flow

1.  User visits the web page.
2.  User pastes or types their text into the "Original Text" area.
3.  (Optional) User adjusts any available control parameters.
4.  User clicks the "Humanize Text" button.
5.  The interface shows a loading indicator while processing (optional, but good for UX).
6.  The "Humanized Text" area is populated with the transformed text from the backend.
7.  (Optional) The "Analysis of Original Text" section is populated.
8.  User can read the humanized text or copy it using the copy button.

## 4. Visual Style

*   Clean, modern, and minimalist design.
*   Good contrast for readability.
*   Responsive design to work on different screen sizes (though desktop-first for this type of tool is acceptable for v1).

## 5. Technology Considerations (Frontend)

*   **HTML:** For the basic structure.
*   **CSS:** For styling (potentially a lightweight framework like Tailwind CSS, or custom CSS).
*   **JavaScript:** For handling user interactions, making API calls to the Flask backend (e.g., using `fetch` or `axios`), and updating the DOM with results.

This design aims for a balance between functionality and simplicity, providing a straightforward way for users to interact with the text humanization capabilities.
