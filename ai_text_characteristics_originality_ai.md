Key takeaways:

*   **Zero grammatical inconsistencies or errors:** AI tools rarely make grammatical mistakes unless prompted with errors.
*   **Repetition or redundancy of words or phrases:** AI follows patterns and tends to reuse the same words and phrases.
*   **Absence of emotion or personality:** AI-generated text is often derivative, flat, unoriginal, and emotionless, lacking the personality humans infuse.
*   **Factual errors:** AI can state 'facts' convincingly but may provide outdated or falsified information as it lacks commonsense understanding.
*   **Unusual choice of words or lack of variation:** While AI might seem convincing, a closer look reveals a lack of variation in language and a tendency to use specific catchphrases.
*   **Lack of context; irrelevance:** AI doesn't understand context and can go off-topic, providing information based only on its inputs.
*   **Lack of tone and style:** Unless skillfully prompted, AI-generated text usually has a bland, uninteresting tone and lacks a unique voice.
*   **Derivative sentences:** AI can produce sentences that say a lot but mean very little, sounding derivative.
